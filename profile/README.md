## This is official MLAB system GitHub organization 

MLAB system is set of hardware and software modules designed for a fast development of new devices. The set of devices or instruments already based on MLAB system is really wide and ranges from a [simple battery charger](https://github.com/MLAB-project/Li-ion-Charger) or [meteor](https://github.com/bolidozor/RMDS) and [lightning](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/RSMS01) detection stations to [cosmic ray detectors](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/AIRDOS02).
The general workflow for that is designing a device prototype based on MLAB modules. Then then new apparatus is extensively tested in several units. After that, the application PCB is designed.

To make that worflow applicable the prototype components needs to be open-source. Therefore the MLAB's key idea is to extensively use open-source design tools like [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/), [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) or [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/). 
In some cases, you can found missing piece (module) to design the prototype you have in the mind. That case is situation, where [your contribution](https://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:rules) is especially helpful.
